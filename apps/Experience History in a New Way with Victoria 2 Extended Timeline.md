Victoria 2 is a grand strategy game that lets you experience the political, economic, and social changes of the 19th and early 20th centuries. But what if you want to play beyond the historical end date of 1936? Or explore alternative scenarios that diverge from history? That's where Victoria 2 Extended Timeline comes in.
 
Victoria 2 Extended Timeline is a mod that extends the timeline of the game from 1821 to 3000, adding new events, decisions, technologies, units, nations, and more. It is based on the popular Vanilla Extended Timeline mod for Victoria 2: Heart of Darkness[^1^], but adds more features and content to enhance your gameplay experience.
